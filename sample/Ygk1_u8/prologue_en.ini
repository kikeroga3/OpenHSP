A team of archaeologists found

a strange ruined site

they called the "God's Grave"


In November of the same year,

People from many different fields

Folklorists, historians, scientists...

A team of 20 experts assembled

and began to examine the

"God's Grave"

But after a few days

A pillar collapsed

in the site.


The entire team was destroyed.

And examinations of the

site were suspended.












A few years later...

A small team of 3 people

began a second examination.



They called in an expert

in black magic.

Thinking that the failure of the

last team was supernatural.

Doing this will keep them

safe this time.





And today...

their expedition begins...
